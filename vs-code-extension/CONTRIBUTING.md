The following is a list of features yet to be implemented in the extension. Any interested parties may contribute by completing or partly completing any of these:

1. Semantic highlighting on the server
Reference: https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide

2. Complete error checking and reporting using a parser
Similarly to the structure defined in: https://github.com/eclipse/che-che4z-lsp-for-cobol/tree/development/server/src/main.
The server uses the parser and lexer files to determine non cobol symbols and reports them to diagnostics as errors.

This may also be helpful: https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide#error-tolerant-parser-for-language-server

3. General autocomplete suggestions outside snippets
Reference: https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide#adding-additional-language-features

4. Any of these features would also be nice, but they have lower priority:
